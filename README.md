# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of **cats and dogs**.  
The model learns visual patterns such as shape, texture, and edges from images and predicts whether the given image belongs to a cat or a dog.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Python-based ML frameworks**, making it suitable for **placements and internships**.
